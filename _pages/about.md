I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Fudan University, [NLP Lab](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/). I am grateful to be advised by [Qi Zhang](http://qizhang.info/).

I have a broad interest in Artificial General Intelligence. My recent work focuses on aligning large language models with human preferences and improving model reasoning using reinforcement learning.

**I will graduate in June 2024, and I am looking for a postdoctoral position!**
